Something to do with twitter and sentiment.

Input: A hashtag or subject
	Use wordnet to broaden search???

Thesaurize things?

Want to be able to label a new tweet as being positive or negative.

Relevant tools:
  WordNet for synonyms and meaning
  At least a Naive Bayes classifier
  nltk.twitter: http://www.nltk.org/howto/twitter.html
    Looks to require twython, and registering with Twitter as a bot.
  
Identify fans vs haters of figures.

Also rank tweets so that we see top 100 most supportive???

Retweets are also comments

So dig through both retweets and comments


Our proposal is to iterate through a hashtag, then rank how supportive or opposed to that topic tweets are.

Then we want to classify by how divergent from the topic people are.

Need to define the math of how we are classifying.


Three parts:

1: Get tweets by hashtag, including front end for user.
	Stretch goal: look at specific popular threads?

2: Classification - pro/anti, stretch goal for other opinions
	Include apathy

3: Ranking
	Find who the most enthusiastic supporters/opponents of a topic are on the hashtag or thread


Maybe add a classification of hotness.



Hashtag 
Support
Biggest fan

Fanantics

Fanatic

Warbler

Class... Class... 

Disparity
	Semantics of support and opposition on Twitter
