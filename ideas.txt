Something to do with twitter and sentiment.

Input: A hashtag or subject
	Use wordnet to broaden search???

Thesaurize things?

Want to be able to label a new tweet as being positive or negative.

Relevant tools:
  WordNet for synonyms and meaning
  At least a Naive Bayes classifier
  nltk.twitter: http://www.nltk.org/howto/twitter.html
    Looks to require twython, and registering with Twitter as a bot.
