# Disparity
## -Semantics of #support and #opposition on Twitter

Our goal is to be able to classify tweets on a topic by how pro- or anti- the topic they are. Then we want to be able to rank tweets by how much they support or oppose. 
* We will have a website that users can go to and search by keyword or hashtag
* We will classify resulting tweets into camps (including apathetic)
* We will rank the tweets by level of engagement
* We will visualize results for easy interpretation

Stretch goals:
* Add in more sorts of classes than support and opposition. 
* Look at comments in relation to the top-level tweets (context-sensitive)
* Look at user profiles, see other interests to create a web
  * (like this: https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/dissecting-trumps-most-rabid-online-following/)
* Identify hot topics
